# Data Analytics Lifecycle Project â€“ Python Interactive Report

This project demonstrates the application of the **Data Analytics Lifecycle** in Python using an interactive Jupyter Notebook. It was completed as part of postgraduate coursework at **University College Cork**. The workflow includes data import, combination, cleaning, feature engineering, and exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Python libraries.

## Objective

The goal is to develop a clear, reproducible pipeline for analysing real-world data by:
- Importing and merging multiple datasets
- Examining and reshaping data structures
- Cleaning and processing data
- Handling missing values and outliers
- Creating new calculated fields
- Performing exploratory data analysis with summary statistics and visuals

## Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Project Highlights

- **Dataset Description**: Summary of data contents and initial issues
- **Data Cleaning**: Reshaping, type corrections, missing/outlier handling
- **Feature Engineering**: Two new calculated fields with rationale
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
  - Descriptive statistics
  - Visualisation (bar plots, histograms, box plots, heatmaps)
  - Insights and pattern detection
